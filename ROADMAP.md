## What works (measured)

Machine: Windows 11 Home 26200, Intel i7-14700KF, 64 GB RAM, NVIDIA RTX 4080 SUPER
(driver 32.0.16.1742), NVMe SSD, GStreamer 1.28.6 MSVC, Rust 1.99. Settings: H.264
`nvd3d11h264enc`, 20 Mbit/s VBR (max 30), GOP 60, no B-frames, capture of a 1280x720
window at 60 fps, test game at 120 fps; audio AAC-LC 160 kbit/s 48 kHz stereo. Numbers
from `cargo xtask e2e` on 2026-10-09. During these runs another game was using the GPU
(up to 99 %), which slowed the test game at times; capture still kept every frame.

Video (M1, re-measured after the M2 timing changes):
- `klip-cli record --buffer 120s` + `klip-cli clip --last 30s`: 30.56 s clip, 1833
  frames, 59.98 fps, frame intervals 16.67 ms at p1–p99 (max 20.1 ms), every barcode
  readable, none repeated or out of order, no gap longer than one capture tick.
- Save time: 83 ms for a 30 s clip with audio, of which 74 ms is waiting for audio to
  reach the clip's end (audio arrives ~50–100 ms after video); the snapshot + write +
  fsync + rename part is ~9 ms (M1: 9.0 ms video-only). CLI round trip incl. process
  start ~60–70 ms more.
- Synthetic exactness test (600 known frames → NVENC → ring → MP4 → ffmpeg decode):
  600/600 frames back, in order; a 2 s cut is exactly 120 frames starting on a keyframe.
- Encoders (M3, `every_working_encoder_round_trips_exactly`, real-time feed, GPU at
  84–99 % from another game): all 14 installed encoders give back every frame exactly
  and cut on keyframes: NVENC D3D11 + CUDA (H.264/H.265/AV1), D3D12 H.264 (both DXGI
  adapters), NVIDIA MF H.264/HEVC (both adapters), Microsoft software MF H.264/HEVC.
- Encoder choice: ranked list for the monitor's GPU (here `nvd3d11h264enc`,
  `d3d12h264enc`, `mfh264enc`, …); isolated probes take 0.9–1.7 s each, once per setup
  (cached); a recorder whose first encoder can't start runs with the next one
  (missing AMF → NVENC: started in 206–227 ms).
- Platform: both monitors here report HDR on (SDR white 120 / 140 nits, peak 400 / 648
  nits), the adapter that drives them, and the virtual-display copy of the GPU.

Audio (M2):
- A/V sync with the test game (beep at every flash, game audio by process loopback):
  30/30 beeps matched in a 30 s clip; audio stamped 0.2–1.0 ms after the audio engine
  played each beep (reference: the game's own WASAPI loopback tap), video 5–10 ms after
  the GPU finished each frame (reference: the game's frame log); net A/V −4.7 to −9.1 ms
  over 4 runs (audio slightly early), spread within one run < 2 ms. Target: ≤ 1 frame
  (16.7 ms).
- Process-loopback lag measured live: 11.5–20.5 ms across sessions, converging within
  the first ~2–4 s (status `audio.process_lag`).
- System-audio path (diagnostic): audio 0.7 ms after the tap.
- AAC (`mfaacenc`): beeps within 0.01 ms of their input time after encode → MP4 → ffmpeg
  decode; encoding 220x real time.
- Clip layout: one input → one named track (e.g. "Game"); with `--mic` → Mix (default,
  played by players), Game, Microphone (disabled alternates for editors).
- Excluded app (`--audio system --exclude-app klip-testgame.exe`): 0 of 10 beeps in the
  clip.
- WASAPI capture: process and system loopback deliver continuous 10 ms packets with QPC
  stamps; a device that can't be opened records silence (unit tests).
- Recorder CPU with game audio + timing reference + NVENC 720p60: 6.2 % of one core.
- Replay ring, MP4 writer (now with track names, enabled flags, alternate groups),
  control channel, frame grid, drift aligner, lag estimator, app-exclusion planner: unit
  and property tests.

## Approximate / not done yet

- **Audio timing references are the test game's own logs.** Video is measured against
  the moment the GPU finished a frame (the compositor shows it at the next refresh, up to
  4.2 ms later on this 239 Hz monitor); audio against the engine's loopback tap. What
  reaches eyes and ears also includes display and audio-device latency, which differ per
  setup. No offset correction is applied.
- **Process-loopback lag** is measured against the default output's mix. If a game plays
  to a non-default device, or is silent, the default 16 ms is used (±3 ms error).
- **Long sessions:** drift correction repeats/drops single frames; not yet measured over
  hours (only seconds to minutes).
- **System audio without music apps:** when two or more music players play at once,
  apps that start playing later are not captured until the next recording.
- **Default device changes** during a recording are not followed (the device chosen at
  start keeps being captured; a removed device becomes silence and is retried).
- **Mic:** no gain, noise suppression or push-to-talk yet; off by default.
- **Save waits for audio** up to 250 ms (typically 50–100 ms).
- Static content gives ~1 fps (WGC only sends changed frames), so desktop capture is VFR.
- **AMF and QSV are unverified**: property names come from the GStreamer docs; no AMD or
  Intel hardware here. VA-API is M4. Hybrid-laptop ranking is by GPU vendor (two GPUs of
  one vendor can't be told apart) and untested on a real laptop.
- **HDR content is clipped** (measured, primary monitor in HDR mode): an HDR game's
  highlights above SDR white become flat white, and with WGC its SDR parts come out too
  bright when the game's paper white isn't 80 nits. SDR games on an HDR desktop are
  exact. Fix in progress (M3.4/M3.5: own FP16 WGC capture + tone-map).
- **NVENC and Media Foundation in one process** (ADR 0009): handled by starting MF first
  and ranking D3D12 before MF hardware, but a session on NVIDIA's MF encoder still breaks
  later NVENC sessions in that process (the start fallback then picks the next encoder).
- DXGI lists the RTX 4080 SUPER twice with different LUIDs (virtual display drivers from
  Parsec / Virtual Desktop); the copy has no outputs and ranks after the real one.
- Exclusive-fullscreen fallback: not done yet (M3.6).
- Not measured yet: FPS cost on a real game, recorder RAM (estimate for the ring:
  `(video + audio bitrate) x 1.5 x (buffer + 1 s)` = 457 MB cap for 120 s at 20 Mbit/s +
  one AAC track).
- If the captured window closes, the recorder keeps the buffer (clips still save) but
  doesn't recover capture; restart/re-target logic comes with game detection (M6).
- Linux: nothing yet (M4).

## Manual checks for the human (M2)

Agents can't play games or listen. When convenient:
1. Record a game you play (`klip-cli record --window-title "<game>"`), save a clip, and
   check by eye/ear that gunshots or footsteps line up with the picture.
2. Same with `--mic` and `--app Discord.exe` during a voice call: the Mix track should
   contain game + voice + mic; open the clip in your editor (Premiere/Resolve/CapCut) and
   check it imports all audio tracks with their names.
3. Play music in Spotify while recording a monitor (`--audio system`): the clip must not
   contain the music.
4. Share a clip to Discord / a phone and check the sound plays (the Mix track).
Do not try this in anti-cheat games until the human decides (AGENTS.md rule 8); process
loopback is an OS API and doesn't touch the game, but that decision is theirs.

## Known bugs

None open.
